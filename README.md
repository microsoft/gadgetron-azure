# Gadgetron in Kubernetes

This repository contains a setup for running a distributed deployment of the [Gadgetron](https://github.com/gadgetron/gadgetron) in a Kubernetes cluster. The setup has been developed for and tested with [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service) but should work on other Kubernetes deploymentes too.

The setup uses [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) to adjust the number of Gadgetron instances (pods) running in the cluster in response to gadgetron activity and it relies on [cluster-autoscaling](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) to adjust the number of nodes. Specifically, an increase reconstruction activity will lead to the deployment of more Gadgetron instances and when the resources on existing nodes are exhausted more will be added. Idle nodes will be removed from the cluster after some idle time. 

Shared files (dependencies and exported data) are stored in persistent volumes, which could be backed by [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/).

The Gadgetron uses a script to discover remote worker nodes. The script is specified in the `GADGETRON_REMOTE_WORKER_COMMAND` environment variable, which references a script added in a ConfigMap. The is also a PreStop lifecycle hook script, which is used to ensure that Gadgetron instances with active connections are not abruptly disconnected. 

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set up a Kubernets cluster. Please see instructions [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](aks-setup.md), [Rancher RKE](rancher-rke-setup.md), or [Minikube](minikube-setup.md).

1. Deploy [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) to allow metrics collection from the Gadgetron:

    ```bash
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    helm upgrade --install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
        --namespace monitoring \
        --create-namespace \
        --set commonLabels.prometheus=monitor \
        --set prometheus.prometheusSpec.serviceMonitorSelector.matchLabels.prometheus=monitor
    ```

    This will install the operator, Prometheus server, Grafana, etc. 

1. Deploy the [Prometheus Adapter](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter):

    ```bash
    helm install --namespace monitoring prometheus-adapter prometheus-community/prometheus-adapter -f custom-metrics/custom-metrics.yaml
    ```

    The Prometheus Adapter is responsible for aggregating metrics from Promtheus and exposing them as custom metrics that we can use for scaling the Gadgetron. Be sure to pay attention to the `prometheus.url` parameter in the `custom-metrics.yaml` file. It has to point to the prometheus operator (find it with `kubectl get svc -n monitoring`).

1. Deploy Gadgetron with helm chart:

    ```bash
    helm install <nameofgadgetroninstance> helm/gadgetron/
    ```

    To select a specific storage class (e.g. Azure Files, Longhorn) for dependencies, etc.:

    ```bash
    helm install <nameofgadgetroninstance> helm/gadgetron/ --set storage.storageClass=azurefile
    ```

    To use a specific node pool:

    ```bash
    helm install --set nodeSelector.agentpool=<nodepoolname> <nameofgadgetroninstance> helm/gadgetron/
    ```

1. Check that metrics are flowing. After deploying the Gadgetron, it should start emitting metrics and they should be exposed as custom metrics. You can check that you can read them with:

    ```bash
    kubectl get --raw /apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/default/pods/*/gadgetron_activity | jq .
    ```

## Connecting with port forwarding

Once the Gadgetron deployment is live, you can find the cluster ip address for the Gadgetron with something like:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

And you can easily open a tunnel from your desktop to the gadgetron with something like:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/<helm release>-gadgetron 9002:9002
```

And then connect directly to `localhost:9002`.

## Connecting with SSH jump server

This repo also contains a helm chart and other artifacts for deploying an SSH jump server in the cluster and you can use this jump server to establish an SSH tunnel. Maintaining these tunnels can be cumbersome and **stunnel (see below) is an easier approach**. That said, an SSH jump server may be the only way to access from say an imaging device. 

### Deploy SSH jump server:

> Approach adopted from [https://github.com/kubernetes-contrib/jumpserver](https://github.com/kubernetes-contrib/jumpserver).

First generate some keys for the SSH server. And store them in a Kubernetes secret. There is a script for doing this:

```bash
./generate_ssh_keys.sh
```

Then store the public for the user to connect, e.g.:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic sshkey --from-file=authorizedkeys=/home/<myuser>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
```

Replace the path the public key with the specific key that you would like to use. Before deploying the SSH jump server you should two secrets (check with `kubectl get keys`) in your cluster: `sshkey` and `ssh-server-keys`.

Then deploy the jump server:

```bash
helm install sshjump helm/sshjump
```

Or if you have given the keys other names with a custom ssh key secret:

```bash
helm install --set sshKeySecret=alternative-ssh-secret-name --set sshServerKeysSecret=alternative-keys-secret-name sshjump2 helm/sshjump/
```

### Connecting with SSH to the jump server

The jump sever enables the "standard" Gadgetron connection paradigm through an SSH tunnel. The Gadgetron instances themselves are not directly accessible. Discover the relvant IPs and open a tunnel with:

```bash
#Public (external) IP:
EXTERNALIP=$(kubectl get svc <sshd-jumpserver-svc> --output=json | jq -r .status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip)

#Internal (cluster) IP:
GTCLUSTERIP=$(kubectl get svc <gadgetron-frontend> --output=json | jq -r .spec.clusterIP)

#Open tunnel:
ssh -L 9022:${GTCLUSTERIP}:9002 root@${EXTERNALIP}
```

## Connecting with stunnel

The repo contains a helm chart for deploying [stunnel](https://stunnel.org) for secure access to the Gadgetron in the cluster. To deploy the `stunnel` server, you must first have some secrets (pre-shared keys). You can generate those and store them as a secret in the cluster with:

```bash
cd stunnel
./create-stunnel-secrets.sh
```

This will create an `stunnel.secrets` file containing 10 client secrets. You can also supply your own file prior to running the script. After running the script confirm that you have an `stunnel` secret in the cluster with `kubectl get secrets`.

If you have deployed the Gadgetron in the cluster with a helm release name of say `gt1`, the DNS name of the gadgetron service would be `gt1-gadgetron` and you can deploy an `stunnel` to interface with that Gadgetron deployment by creating a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
stunnel:
  secretName: stunnel
  connections:
    gadgetron:
      listenPort: 9002
      connectHost: gt1-gadgetron
      connectPort: 9002
service:
  dnsPrefix: mytunneldnsname
```
The `service.dnsPrefix` is optional, but when deployed in AKS, it will assign a DNS name to the public IP address of the `LoadBalancer` so that you can reference it with something like `mytunneldnsname.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com` instead of the IP address, which may change as you redeploy.

Then deploy the `stunnel` with:

```bash
helm upgrade --install -f values.yaml
```

On some other host on your (on-prem) network, you can then install `stunnel` and create an `stunnel.conf` file:

```
[gadgetron]
client = yes
accept = 9002
connect = <ip or dns name of tunnel service>:9002
PSKsecrets = stunnel.secrets
```

The `stunnel.secrets` file must contain one of the pre-shared secrets created with the `create-stunnel-secrets.sh`, e.g. it could look like:

```
client1:4ZYJY+HoIX1xxZM563VpppejPJNQ4S4Z
```

Start the stunnel with:

```bash
stunnel stunnel.conf
```

And you should now be able to connect to the Gadgetron from port 9002 on the host where you are running the `stunnel` client.

## Connecting with VPN (Azure)

You can use VPN to connect to the Gadgetron in the Kubernetes cluster, it is recommended that you establish a VPN point to site connection. Please consult the [Azure P2S VPN guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal). The basic steps are:

1. Create a gateway subnet in your [AKS cluster network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/concepts-network).
1. Create a VPN Gateway in the subnet.
1. Obtain/generate keys and [install client software](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert).
1. Connect securely using VPN connection.
